# PWA-Text-Editor

## User Story

```md
AS A developer
I WANT to create notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection
SO THAT I can reliably retrieve them for later use
```

## Description

Build a text editor that runs in the browser. The app will be a single-page application that meets the PWA criteria. Additionally, it will feature a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application will also function offline>

## Difficulties 

When first working on this project I was running into a road block was on the ``` src-sw.jw``` file when needing to implement asset caching

## Solutions

I was able to better understand the implementation wanted ```asset caching ``` by reading multiple docs.
